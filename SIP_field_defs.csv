An approach Buffett uses to project the annual compound rate of return based on historical earnings per share increases. Earnings are first projected out ten years based upon the historical seven- year earnings growth rate. For example, take company in which current earnings per share are $2.77 and earnings per share have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 18.9% over the last seven years. If earnings per share increase for the next 10 years at this same growth rate of 18.9%, earnings per share in year 10 will be $15.64. [$2.77 * ((1 + 0.189)^10)]. The projected earnings per share figure is then multiplied by the company's historical average price- earnings ratio of 14.0 to provide an estimate of price [$15.64 * 14.0=$218.96]. If dividends are paid, an estimate of the amount of dividends paid over the 10-year period are also added to the year 10 price [$218.96 + $13.32 = $232.28]. comparing the projected total gain of $232.28 to the current price of $48.25 leads projected rate of return of 17.0% [($232.28/$48.25) ^ (1/10) - 1]. Used in the Buffettology-EPS Growth screen."

The expected annual return based upon the sustainable growth rate model. Buffett uses the average rate of return on equity and average retention ratio (1 - average payout ratio) to calculate the sustainable growth rate [ROE * (1 - payout ratio)]. The sustainable growth rate is used to estimate the book value per share in year 10 [BVPS ((1 + sustainable growth rate)^10)]. Earnings per share is then estimated in year 10 by multiplying the average return on equity by the projected book value per share [ROE * BVPS]. To estimate the future price, the estimated earnings per share is multiplied by the average price-earnings ratio [EPS * P/E]. If dividends are paid, they are added to the projected price to compute the total gain. For example, a company would have a sustainable growth rate of 19.2% if its average ROE was 22.8%, and average payout ratio was 15.9% [22.8% * (1 - 0.159)]. Thus, its current book value per share of $11.38 should grow at this rate to roughly $65.90 in 10 years [$11.38 * ((1 + 0.192)^10)]. If return on equity remains 22.8% in the tenth year, earnings per share that year would be $15.03 [0.228 * $65.90]. The estimated earnings per share can then be multiplied by the average price-earnings ratio of 14.0 to project the price of $210.42 [$15.03 * 14.0]. Since dividends are paid, an estimate of the amount of dividends paid over the 10-year period is added to the projected stock price to project the rate of return of 16.5% [(($210.42 + $12.71)/ $48.25) ^ (1/10) - 1]. Buffett requires a return of at least 15%. Used in the Buffettology-Sustain Growth screen."

However, too high a current ratio may point to unnecessary investment in current assets, or an inability on the company's part to collect accounts receivable, or an inflated inventory.

On the other hand, too low a current ratio implies illiquidity and the potential for the company to be unable to meet current liabilities in the event of random shocks, such as strikes, that temporarily reduce the inflow of cash.

"215","MG (Market Guide) average senior debt rating","DEBT_RATE","Company Information","Character","No","No"," The Market Guide senior debt rating is derived from the current bond ratings of Fitch Investors Services, Moody's Investors Services, and the Standard & Poor's Rating Group. The Market Guide senior debt rating is derived from the current bond ratings of Fitch Investors Services, Moody's Investors Services, and the Standard & Poor's Rating Group. The rating system, as provided by Market Guide, is as follows: Investment Grade AAA Considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality. The obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest and repay principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events. AA Investment grade and of very high credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong, although not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA. A Considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings. BBB Considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be adequate. Speculative Grade BB The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal may be affected over time by adverse economic changes. B Considered highly speculative. While bonds in this class are currently meeting debt service requirements, the probability of continued timely payment of principal and interest reflects the obligor's limited margin of safety and the need for reasonable business and economic activity throughout the life of the issue. CCC Bonds have certain identifiable characteristics which, if not remedied, may lead to default. The ability to meet obligations requires an advantageous business and economic environment. CC Bonds are minimally protected. Default on payment of interest and/or principal seems probable over time. C Bonds are in imminent default of interest or principal. DDD, DD, D Bonds are in default on interest and/or principal payments. Such bonds are extremely speculative and should be valued on the basis of their ultimate recovery in liquidation or reorganization of the obligor. Plus (+) or minus (-) signs: These signs are used after a rating symbol to designate the relative position within the rating grade. The signs are carried in ratings from AA to B."

In addition, the higher the ratio, the more flexibility a company has in being able to meet its financial obligations and have money left over for dividends, expansion, etc. Interest on debt obligations must be paid, regardless of a company's future potential. Failure to do so will result in default if the lender is not willing to restructure debt obligations. As this ratio falls, the risk of a company defaulting on its debt obligations increases. A ratio of less than one indicates that company's current earnings are not high enough to meet their current debt obligations, meaning they will need to liquidate assets to make up the shortfall or find additional funding.
